# Exec Docs Agent

Welcome to Exec Docs Agent! This tool helps you convert documents and troubleshoot errors efficiently using OpenAI's Large Language Models and the Azure Innovation Engine.

## Features

- Converts input documents using OpenAI's LLMs.
- Automatically installs required packages and the Innovation Engine.
- Runs tests on the converted document using the Innovation Engine.
- Provides detailed error logs and generates troubleshooting steps.
- Logs execution data to a CSV file for analytics.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- An Azure OpenAI API key
- A GitHub access token
- Required Python packages: `openai`, `azure-identity`, `requests`, `pygithub`

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```

2. Install the required Python packages:
    ```bash
    pip install openai azure-identity requests pygithub
    ```

3. Ensure you have the Azure OpenAI API key and GitHub access token set as environment variables:
    ```bash
    export AZ

URE

_OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-azure-openai-api-key>
    export AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=<your-azure-openai-endpoint>
    export GitHub_Token=<your-github-access-token>
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the script:
    ```bash
    python ada.py
    ```

2. Enter the path to the file you want to convert when prompted.

## Script Workflow

1. **Initialization**: The script initializes the Azure OpenAI client and checks for required packages.
2. **Input File**: Prompts the user to enter the path to the input file.
3. **System Prompt**: Loads the system prompt from `create.txt`.
4. **File Content**: Reads the content of the input file.
5. **Install Innovation Engine**: Checks if the Innovation Engine is installed and installs it if necessary.
6. **Conversion and Testing**:
    - Attempts to convert the document using OpenAI's GPT-4 model.
    - Runs tests on the converted document using the Innovation Engine.
    - If tests fail, generates troubleshooting steps and attempts to correct the document.
7. **Remove Backticks**: Ensures the first and last lines of the converted document do not contain backticks.
8. **Logging**: Logs execution data to `execution_log.csv`.

## Logging

The script logs the following data to `execution_log.csv`:

- Timestamp: The date and time when the script was run.
- Input File Path: The path to the input file.
- Output File Path: The path to the output file.
- Number of Attempts: The number of attempts made to generate a successful document.
- Errors Encountered: A summary of errors encountered during the process.
- Chain of Thoughts: The troubleshooting steps generated by the model.
- Execution Time: The total time taken to run the script.
- Success/Failure: Whether the script successfully generated a document without errors.
